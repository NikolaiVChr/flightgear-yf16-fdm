Todo for FGAddon f16 YF variant.
================================

Properties that my fly-by-wire system has to map into to animate f16 model:

/surface-positions/rudder-pos-norm       -> fcs/fly-by-wire/yaw/rudder-pos-norm
fdm/jsbsim/fcs/dht-right-pos-rad         -> fcs/fly-by-wire/pitch/horz-tail-right-deflection-deg
fdm/jsbsim/fcs/dht-left-pos-rad          -> fcs/fly-by-wire/pitch/horz-tail-left-deflection-deg
/surface-positions/left-aileron-pos-norm -> fcs/fly-by-wire/roll/flaperon-left-deflection-deg
/surface-positions/right-aileron-pos-norm-> fcs/fly-by-wire/roll/flaperon-right-deflection-deg
fdm/jsbsim/fcs/left-flaperon-norm        -> fcs/fly-by-wire/roll/flaperon-left-deflection-deg
fdm/jsbsim/fcs/right-flaperon-norm       -> fcs/fly-by-wire/roll/flaperon-right-deflection-deg
fdm/jsbsim/fcs/lef-pos-deg               -> fcs/fly-by-wire/lef/lef-pos-deg



Todo for YF-16
==============
Place fuel tanks and pilot and make it so they don't disrupt CG too much.
Make all coefficients functions (like Cy is)
Put in engine gyroscopic effect (160 slugs-ft2/sec)
